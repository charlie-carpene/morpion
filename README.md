**You'll find in this repo:**
  - This readme ;)
  - Gemfile & Gemfile.lock for all gems required
  - The repository "lib" with all ruby files needed for the game
  - The repository rspec  for tests (but there's nothing working in it yet unfortunately)
  - The app.rb file which will allow you to launch a game by typing "ruby app.rb" in  your terminal.

**To start the game :**
  - Clone / Download the whole repository
  - From it, type Bundle install from your terminal
  - Then you can try ruby app.rb and see what happens
